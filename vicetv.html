<p>When VICE LAB, the experimental unit of VICE TV, heard I wrote obituaries, they came up with the idea of "living obituaries." I hang out with a young artist for the day, then come home and write their obituary. The idea is to get beneath the shallow, of-the-moment coverage the celebrity-hungry media gives artists these days and see them more in the context of Time.</p>
